# @backstage/plugin-xcmetrics

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 616e10e94: New data in form of trend lines, status timeline and other is added to the dashboard of XCMetrics to give a better understanding of how the build system is behaving.

### Patch Changes

- 9d40fcb1e: - Bumping `material-ui/core` version to at least `4.12.2` as they made some breaking changes in later versions which broke `Pagination` of the `Table`.
  - Switching out `material-table` to `@material-table/core` for support for the later versions of `material-ui/core`
  - This causes a minor API change to `@backstage/core-components` as the interface for `Table` re-exports the `prop` from the underlying `Table` components.
  - `onChangeRowsPerPage` has been renamed to `onRowsPerPageChange`
  - `onChangePage` has been renamed to `onPageChange`
  - Migration guide is here: https://material-table-core.com/docs/breaking-changes
- Updated dependencies
  - @backstage/core-components@0.2.0
  - @backstage/core-plugin-api@0.1.4
  - @backstage/theme@0.2.9
